Hello!
First day was spent getting to know Kotlin again after writing in other languages for a while.
I made the list as a Singelton to get easy access to it and because the whole app is based on it.
We just started to learn about API and JSON in the React course I am taking now and have only used it as a list. At first I tried reading up on Kotlin and fetching API
but it took to much time so I just copied some of the comic image urls to my own list.

I have not been writing in Android Studio since out Android course and I realize that there is much to be learned, mainly about the design tool. I will spend time on that this summer.
I wanted the search-button inside the searchEditText to be more aligned and take up the same amount of height as the searchEditText but I could not solve it.
I also spent some time trying to learn how to do a Fragment design to move the search function to its own fragment so that the recycle view wouldn't show below the matching comic but it took to much time.

I choose the features that I thought would be possible for me to do within the time limit.
With the list and ComicStrip class in separate files it will be easier to make improvements and extend the features.
It was much fun to go back to Kotlin and Android Studio and I now know what I will be doing during the summer break. :-)

Time spent: 11,5 hours
