Hello!
First day was spent getting to know Kotlin again after writing in other languages for a while and
also to remembering how to do a recyclerview.
I made the list as a Singelton to get easy access to it and because the whole app is based on it.
I have only used API's as a list in Javascript before and therefore just copied some of the comic image urls to my own list.
Time spent: 4 hours (+ 1,5 hour on evening)

Second day was all about design and getting that explanation and searchfunction in place.

General notes:
